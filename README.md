Start From import JSON to googlesheet by Apps Script first 
and then inspect template workbook 
and then try to replicate and so on til it done. 
It's end up like his design but not fully functional as his but i'm happy with it now. ü§ò
This project make me learn new thing and fun.

- **2021/W13: UK Exports to EU have plunged since Brexit**

UK Exports to EU plunge by 40% in first month since Brexit

The imposition of a new Covid lockdown resulted in the biggest monthly decline in British trade for more than 20 years.
Experts said the scale of the decline in January trade was unlikely to be permanent because there was evidence companies stockpiled goods before the Brexit deadline, meaning they would not need to send as many shipments as usual in January.

- **Pick up a book and read!**

#MakeoverMonday 2020/w38: Pick up a book and read!

Social distancing, lockdowns, teleworking and tele-schooling, introduced to limit the damages by the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the European Union (EU) and the world, force most of us to spend most of our time at home. So why not make the best of it? Pick up a book and read! Let your imagination free, expand your horizons and learn something new ‚Äì alone, with your children or your parents!
 
Buying a book is relatively affordable. The price of books in the EU is growing more slowly than the total consumer prices, as measured by the monthly Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). Between February 2010 and February 2020, the price of books increased by 9%, compared to 14% for total consumer prices.

This chart tell us **Who is the best Professor in thailand (in there field)**, Firstly you can Choose whatever **Field of Study** then choose **Measurement**. because every field of study is different, I make this visualization to fair compare in the same field. I also include some simple count of *H Index* and percentage in the *right tab* for those who curious. However [H-index is not a perfect measurement](http://ortho2.md.chula.ac.th/index.php/h-index.html), I have a plan to make it show new indicator refer to [new criteria and procedure for appointing a person
To hold the position of Assistant Professor Associate Professor And professor](http://www.personnel.psu.ac.th/per10.html) and since this [new criteria and procedure is not better than previous](https://www.isranews.org/article/isranews-article/89858-theera.html), Industry insiders have commented that it is inappropriate to use at this time. It has been announced to [postpone its enforcement for another 3 years](https://www.matichon.co.th/education/news_2247070). It's my personal 2020 week 34, But this Viz is not for #MakeoverMonday, I makeover for a friends.
